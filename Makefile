# Makefile for the README.llm Generator Project

# --- Configuration ---
# Use ':=' for a simple variable assignment that is evaluated only once.
IMAGE_NAME := readme-llm-generator

# Use '?=' to set REPO_PATH only if it's not already set.
# This allows it to be passed from the command line.
REPO_PATH ?=

# Export IMAGE_NAME for scripts to use
export IMAGE_NAME

# --- Shell Scripts ---
# Define paths to the scripts for easier maintenance
BUILD_SCRIPT := ./scripts/create-image.sh
# RUN_SCRIPT is no longer needed as generate-readme-llm.sh is called directly.

# --- Commands ---
# .PHONY declares targets that are not actual files.
.PHONY: help setup build run clean test

# The default command executed when you just type 'make'.
default: help
